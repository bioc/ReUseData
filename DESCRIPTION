Description: ReUseData is an _R/Bioconductor_ software tool to provide
    a systematic and versatile approach for standardized and
    reproducible data management. ReUseData facilitates transformation
    of shell or other ad hoc scripts for data preprocessing into
    workflow-based data recipes. Evaluation of data recipes generate
    curated data files in their generic formats (e.g., VCF, bed). Both
    recipes and data are cached using database infrastructure for easy
    data management and reuse. Pre-built data recipes are available
    through ReUseData portal ("https://rcwl.org/dataRecipes/") with
    full annotation and user instructions. Pre-generated data are
    available through ReUseData cloud bucket that is directly
    downloadable through "getCloudData()".
