`ReUseData` provides functionalities to construct workflow-based data
recipes for fully tracked and reproducible data processing. Evaluation
of data recipes generates curated data resources in their generic
formats (e.g., VCF, bed), as well as a YAML manifest file recording
the recipe parameters, data annotations, and data file paths for
subsequent reuse. The datasets are locally cached using a database
infrastructure, where updating and searching of specific data is made easy.  

The data reusability is assured through cloud hosting and enhanced
interoperability with downstream software tools or analysis
workflows. The workflow strategy enables cross platform
reproducibility of curated data resources.

# Installation
1. Install the package from _Bioconductor_.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ReUseData")
```
The development version is also available to download from GitHub. 
```{r getDevel, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("rworkflow/ReUseData")
```

2. Load the package and other packages into the R session.
```{r Load, message=FALSE}
library(ReUseData)
library(Rcwl)
library(RcwlMeta)
```
		
# Data resources 

Some curated data resources from public database are available on
cloud space with user-friendly discovery and access through the
`ReUseData` portal, where detailed instructions are provided for
straight-forward incorporation into data analysis pipelines run on
local computing nodes, web resources, and cloud computing platforms
(e.g., Terra, CGC).

FIXME: 
- cloud bucket of data
- data portal instructions
- data recipe private repository
- testthat
- additional recipes... 
- add `RcwlMeta` functions to `Rcwl`.

# `ReUseData` core functions for data management 

Here we introduce the core functions of `ReUseData` for data
management and reuse: `getData` for reproducible data generation,
`dataUpdate` for syncing and updating data cache, and `dataSearch` for
multi-keywords searching of dataset of interest.


## Data generation

First, we can construct data recipes by transforming shell or other ad
hoc data preprocessing scripts into workflow-based data recipes. Some
pre-built data recipes for public data resources (e.g., downloading
and indexing) are available for direct use through `recipeSearch` and
`recipeLoad` functions. Then we will assign values to the input
parameters and evaluate the recipe to generate data of interest.

```{r}
recipeSearch(c("gencode", "transcript"))
rcp <- recipeLoad("gencode_transcripts")
inputs(rcp)
```

Users can then assign values to the input parameters, and evaluate the
recipe (`getData`) to generate data of interest. Users need to specify
an output directory for all files and a file prefix for the
concomitant files that are internally generated as workflow scripts or
annotation files. Detailed notes for the data is encouraged which will
be used for keywords matching for later data search.

```{r}
rcp$species <- "human"
rcp$version <- "42"
outdir <- file.path(tempdir(), "SharedData")
res <- getData(rcp,
        outdir = outdir, 
        prefix = "gencode_annotation_human_42",
        notes = c("gencode", "human", "42"),
        showLog = TRUE)
```

The file path to newly generated dataset can be easily retrieved. It
can also be retrieved using `dataSearch()` functions with multiple
keywords. Before that, `dataUpdate()` needs to be done.  

```{r}
res$output
```

There are some automatically generated files to help track the data
recipe evaluation, including `*.sh` to record the original shell
script, `*.cwl` file as the official workflow script which was
internally submitted for data recipe evaluation, `*.yml` file as part
of CWL workflow evalution, which also record data annotations, and
`*.md5` checksum file to check/verify the integrity of generated data
file.

```{r}
dir(outdir, pattern = "gencode_annotation_human_42")
```

The `*.yml` file contains information about recipe input parameters,
the file path to output file, the notes for the dataset, and
auto-added date for data generation time. A later data search using
`dataSearch()` will refer to this file for keywords match.

```{r}
readLines(res$yml)
```

## Data caching and updating 

`dataUpdate()` creates (if first itme use), syncs and update the local
cache for curated datasets. It finds and reads all the `.yml` files
recursivelly in the provided data folder, creates a cache record for
each dataset that is associated (including newly generated ones with
`getData()`, and update the local cache for later data searching and
reuse.

**NOTE:** It is recommended that users create a specified folder for
data archival (e.g., `file/path/to/SharedData`) that other group
members have access to, and use sub-folders for different kinds of
datasets.

```{r}
dataUpdate(dir = outdir)
```

`dataUpdate` and `dataSearch` return a `dataHub` object with a list of
all available or matching datasets. 

```{r}
dd <- dataSearch(c("gencode", "42"))
dd
```

One can subset the list with `[` and use getter functions to retrieve
the annotation information about the data, e.g., data names,
parameters values to the recipe, notes and tags.

```{r}
dd[1]
dataNames(dd)
dataParams(dd)
dataNotes(dd)
dataTags(dd)
```

`ReUseData`, as the name suggests, commits to promoting the data reuse.
Data can be prepared in standard input formats (`toList`), e.g.,
YAML and JSON, to be easily integrated in workflow methods that are
locally or cloud-hosted. 

```{r}
toList(dd)
toList(dd, format = "json")
toList(dd, format = "yaml")
```

Data can also be aggregated from different resources by tagging with
specific software tools (dataTag). 

```{r}
DataSearch()
dataTags(dd) <- "#gatk"
dataSearch("#gatk")
```

# SessionInfo
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
